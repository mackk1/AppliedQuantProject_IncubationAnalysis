# Project
Repository for analysis of lethal and sublethal responses of _P. armatus_ to cold water temperatures. This analysis uses the Survival package to generate survivorship curves and determine differences in hazard between main effects. Lethal effects are tested in the survival files, sublethal responses are tested based on righting responses.

**Index:**

**Use:**

Conducting analysis for both Righting Response and Survival is very similar.  Both include two markdown files, one for conducting the overall analysis and another for generating publication figures. Each analysis.Rmd walks through four basic steps: (1)an exploratory analysis, (2)an analysis of main effects, (3) an analysis of spatial scales, and (4) in-depth analysis for individual figures. Each figures.Rmd generates five figures. 

**Abstract:**

The green porcelain crab, _Petrolisthes armatus_, is an intertidal anomuran crab with a native
range extending from the Indian River, FL south to Brazil. In the mid-1990s, the species invaded
northward and established populations on intertidal oyster reefs along the South Atlantic Bight,
first appearing in Charleston, SC and later expanding as far north as Wilmington, NC.
_Petrolisthes armatus_ appears limited in its poleward expansion by its intolerance of extreme cold
winter temperatures, although the mechanism is not well understood. Crabs collected from five
locations within the species&#39; northernmost invaded range from Savannah, GA to Wilmington, NC
were used in incubation trials to determine whether cold temperatures experienced by adults
induce different sublethal (loss of righting response) or lethal effects among locations, between
crab size categories, or between sexes. Following an acclimation period, crabs were exposed to a
chronic cold temperature trial informed by the January 2014 cold snap in Charleston Harbor, SC.
Crabs from more northerly locations survived significantly longer as temperatures decreased.
Regardless of location, females survived and maintained the righting response longer than males.
These results suggest differences in cold tolerance between sexes, and indicate that thermal
tolerance may vary along a latitudinal gradient in _P. armatus_.
