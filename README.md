# Project
Repository for analysis of lethal and sublethal responses of P. armatus to cold water temperatures. This analysis uses the Survival package to generate survivorship curves and determine differences in hazard between main effects. Lethal effects are tested in the survival files, sublethal responses are tested based on righting responses.
