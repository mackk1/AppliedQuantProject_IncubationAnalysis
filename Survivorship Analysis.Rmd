Exploratory Analysis
--
First, I run an ANCOVA of the main effects. This indicates that Sex was the strongest effect, followed by the covariate Carapace Width, and Site. There was a signigicant block effect. There were no significant interactions

Next, I generated box plots to visually summarize the sex and site data

```{r}
KM_Survival <- read.csv("~/Incubation Analysis/Trial1_survival.csv")
names(KM_Survival)
sapply(KM_Survival, class)
KM_Survival$Block=as.factor(KM_Survival$Block)
sapply(KM_Survival, class)
Males=subset(KM_Survival, Sex=='Male')
Females=subset(KM_Survival, Sex=='Female')

library(survival)
library(KMsurv)

#ANCOVA of main effects
options(contrasts=c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))
fit1=(aov(lm(Duration~Site*Sex*Block+CW, data=KM_Survival)))
drop1(fit1,~.,test='F')

#Boxplots
plot(KM_Survival$Sex, KM_Survival$Duration)
plot(KM_Survival$Site, KM_Survival$Duration)
plot(KM_Survival$CW,KM_Survival$Duration)
plot(KM_Survival$Duration, KM_Survival$CW ) #closley related to sex. Examine males and females separetely?
plot(Males$CW, Males$Duration)
plot(Females$CW, Females$Duration)

plot(CW~Duration, data=Males)
abline(lm(CW~Duration, data=Males))
points(CW~Duration, data=Females, col='Blue')
summary(lm(CW~Duration, data=Males))

plot(CW~Duration, data=Females) 
abline(lm(CW~Duration, data=Females))
summary(lm(CW~Duration, data=Females))

#KM Curves of main effects
mod1=survfit(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site+Sex, data=KM_Survival)
plot(mod1, ylab='righting probabilty', xlab='Duration', main='Model 1') #disregard everything

#Log Rank test of main effects tests for differences
mod1_dif=survdiff(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site+Sex, data=KM_Survival)
mod1_dif

#Cox proportional hazards model fit
mod1_cox=coxph(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site+Sex+CW, data=KM_Survival)
summary(mod1_cox)

#ANOVA of main effects 
anova(mod1_cox)

```

Analysis of Sex
--

First, I show the mean duration for females and males, and create a basic survivorship curves for males vs females. These will be replaced with presentation quality figures.

Next, I run a GLM to test the effect of Block and Sex on survivorship, it gives a significant result of sex, despite the block effect. 

Next, a survivorship analysis tests (log rank test) if there is a difference between the male and female survivorship curves. This test shows that survivorship curves differ significantly. 

Finally, a test of my model indicates that the survivorship probabilities I observed are very unlikely to occur randomly.

```{r}
#Mean duration of sexes
tapply(KM_Survival$Duration,KM_Survival$Sex,mean)

#KM Curve
plot(survfit(Surv(Duration,Status)~Sex, data=KM_Survival),lty=c(1,2),xlab ='Time (hours)', ylab = 'Survival Probability')
legend(25,0.2,c('Females', 'Males'),lty=c(1,2))

#log rank test of main effects tests for differences between sexes
sex_dif = survdiff(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Sex, data=KM_Survival) #tests if there is a difference between survival curves
sex_dif

#Cox proportional hazards model fit
sex_cox = coxph(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Sex, data=KM_Survival)
summary(sex_cox)

#ANOVA of Sex Differences 
anova(sex_cox)

#establishes that differences exist between sexes
```

Analysis of Site
--
First, show then mean duration at each site, then generate survivorship curves for each site. These will be replaced with presentation quality figures. 

Next, I run a GLM to determine differences between sites. Trask, Roebling House, Pinckney, and Grice differ. Needs further analysis

Next, I run a survivorship analysis to test differences in my curves. 

Finally, I test the fit of my model

```{r}
#Mean Duration by site
tapply(KM_Survival$Duration,KM_Survival$Site,mean)

#ugly KM curve
plot(survfit(Surv(Duration,Status)~Site, data=KM_Survival),lty=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8),xlab ='Time (hours)', ylab = 'Survival Probability')
legend(25,0.5,c('Bly Creek', 'Bowens Island', 'Extension Office','Grice','Pinckney','Roebling House','Town Creek', 'Trask'),lty=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8))

#log rank test of main effects tests for differences between sites
site_dif = survdiff(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site, data=KM_Survival) #tests if there is a difference between survival curves
site_dif

#Cox proportional hazards model fit
site_cox = coxph(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site, data=KM_Survival)
summary(site_cox)

#ANOVA of Sex Differences 
anova(site_cox)

#establishes that differences exist between sites, and that Grice, Pinckney, and Roebling House are weakest?
```




Analysis of Sex by Site

This analysis gets messy, and may be best visually explored
--
Females by site
-
First I generate a boxplot and messy survivorship curves

GLM shows significant block effect, and that at one site female survivorship is significantly different from the others. Generally, females responded the same. Survivorship analysis shows significant difference in curves and model fit test indicates that the results are unlikely to occur by random chance.

```{r}
#subset females by site
KM_Survival_F=subset(KM_Survival, Sex =="Female")

#means
tapply(KM_Survival_F$Duration,KM_Survival_F$Site,mean)

#Box Plots
plot(KM_Survival_F$Site,KM_Survival_F$Duration)

#ugly KM curve
plot(survfit(Surv(Duration,Status)~Site, data=KM_Survival_F),lty=c(1:8),xlab ='Time (hours)', ylab = 'Survival Probability')
legend(25,0.5,c('Bly Creek', 'Bowens Island', 'Extension Office','Grice','Pinckney','Roebling House','Town Creek', 'Trask'),lty=c(1,8))

#log rank test of main effects tests for difference in females between sites
difference_F = survdiff(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site, data=KM_Survival_F) 
difference_F

#Cox proportional hazards model fit
cox_F = coxph(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site, data=KM_Survival_F)
summary(cox_F)

anova(cox_F)
```

Males by Site
-
First, I generate a boxplot and messy survivorship curves. Curves for males clearly drop off more quickly than females

GLM shows block effect, and that males at some sites responded differently than others. The curves are significantly different, and the results are unlikely to occur by chance. 

```{r}
#plot males by site
KM_Survival_M=subset(KM_Survival, Sex =="Male")

#means
tapply(KM_Survival_M$Duration,KM_Survival_M$Site,mean)

#Box Plots
plot(KM_Survival_M$Site,KM_Survival_M$Duration)

#ugly KM curve
plot(survfit(Surv(Duration,Status)~Site, data=KM_Survival_M),lty=c(1:8),xlab ='Time (hours)', ylab = 'Survival Probability')
legend(25,0.5,c('Bly Creek', 'Bowens Island', 'Extension Office','Grice','Pinckney','Roebling House','Town Creek', 'Trask'),lty=c(1,8))

#log rank test of main effects tests for difference in females between sites
difference_M = survdiff(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site, data=KM_Survival_M) 
difference_M

#Cox proportional hazards model fit
cox_M = coxph(Surv(Duration,Status)~Block+Site, data=KM_Survival_M)
summary(cox_M)
anova(cox_M)
```
